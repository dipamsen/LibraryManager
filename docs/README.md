# Library Manager - Project Report

Open `report.pdf` to view the project report.

It is written in [Typst](https://typst.app) and is compiled to PDF using the Typst compiler.

The source code for the project in `src` is used to generate a `code.typ` file using a custom script. This file is then included in the report.

## Compiling

To compile the report, you need to install Typst. Then, run the following command:

```bash
typst compile main.typ
```
